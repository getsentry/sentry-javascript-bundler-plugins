## 3.4.0

- fix: Replace existing debug ID comments (#730)
- feat: Expose bundler plugin primitives via `createSentryBuildPluginManager` (#714)

## 3.3.1

- fix(webpack5): All `esm` files must have `.mjs` postfix (#721)

## 3.3.0

- feat(webpack): Add `@sentry/webpack-plugin/webpack5` export for webpack 5.1+ and compatible environments (#715)
- feat: Only do automatic commit association for Vercel production environments (#711)

## 3.2.4

- Revert "feat(core): Use path instead of debug IDs as artifact names for debug ID upload (#700)" (#709)
- ref: Remove deprecated use of `useArtifacBundles` (#707)

## 3.2.3

- feat(core): Use path instead of debug IDs as artifact names for debug ID upload (#700)
- feat(webpack): Primarily use `contentHash` for debug ID hash (#702)
- feat: Detect Vercel commits and env (#694)
- feat: Default to automatically setting commits on release (#692)

## 3.2.2

- deps: Bump `@sentry/cli` to `2.41.1` (#671)

- fix(core): Disable release creation and source maps upload in dev mode (#666)

  This fix disables any external calls to the Sentry API for managing releases or uploading source maps, when detecting that the plugin is running in dev-mode. While this rarely actually happened,
  it also polluted the dev server output with unnecessary logs about missing auth tokens, which shouldn't
  be required in dev mode.

- feat(webpack): Gate forced process exit behind experimental flag (#663)

## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Injected code will now use `let`, which was added in ES6 (ES2015).
  This means that ES6 is the minimum JavaScript version that the Sentry bundler plugins support.

- Deprecated options have been removed:
  - `deleteFilesAfterUpload` - Use `filesToDeleteAfterUpload` instead
  - `bundleSizeOptimizations.excludePerformanceMonitoring` - Use `bundleSizeOptimizations.excludeTracing` instead
  - `_experiments.moduleMetadata` - Use `moduleMetadata` instead
  - `cleanArtifacts` - Did not do anything

### List of Changes

- fix!: Wrap injected code in block-statement to contain scope (#646)
- chore!: Remove deprecated options (#654)
- feat(logger): Use console methods respective to log level (#652)
- fix(webpack): Ensure process exits when done (#653)

You can configure the `sourcemaps` option as follows:

```js
plugin({
  org: "Your organization",
  project: "Your project",
  authToken: "Your auth token",

  sourcemaps: {
    // Specify the directory containing build artifacts
    assets: "./dist/**",
  },
});
```
