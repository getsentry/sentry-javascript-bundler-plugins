The hook is called with the absolute path of the build artifact and the value of the \`//# sourceMappingURL=\`
comment, if present. The hook should then return an absolute path (or a promise that resolves to one) indicating
where to find the artifact's corresponding source map file. If no path is returned or the returned path doesn't
exist, the standard source map resolution process will be used.

The standard process first tries to resolve based on the \`//# sourceMappingURL=\` value (it supports \`file://\`
urls and absolute/relative paths). If that path doesn't exist, it then looks for a file named
\`\${artifactName}.map\` in the same directory as the artifact.

Note: This is mostly helpful for complex builds with custom source map generation. For example, if you put source
maps into a separate directory and rewrite the \`//# sourceMappingURL=\` comment to something other than a relative
directory, sentry will be unable to locate the source maps for a given build artifact. This hook allows you to 
implement the resolution process yourself.

Use the \`debug\` option to print information about source map resolution.
